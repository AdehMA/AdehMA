# AdehMA - Adnane El Hamdaoui

👋 Hey there! I'm Adnane El Hamdaoui, a 27-year-old programming enthusiast born on March 5, 1996. I've recently embarked on my programming journey, fueled by a passion that's been burning since my early years.

🚀 My fascination lies in embedded systems, and I'm on a quest to delve deeper into this exciting realm. Currently wielding the C programming language, I'm gearing up to explore the intricacies of assembly language.

📚 Although I'm not currently enrolled in formal studies, I'm gearing up for an adventure at 1337 School in Benguerir next year. It's never too late to learn, right?

🌐 When I'm not in the coding zone, I'm the proud owner of two Discord servers: "The Low Level Chads" and "1337 Hub." The former is a haven for low-level programming enthusiasts, while the latter serves as a vibrant community hub for all things related to 1337 School.

Excited to connect and collaborate with fellow coding enthusiasts! Let's build some awesome stuff together! 🚀
